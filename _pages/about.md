I am a PhD student in Computer & Information Science at **UPenn** specializing in **NeuroAI** with a focus on **sequence modeling**. I’m a member of the **[NerDS Lab](https://nerdslab.github.io/about.html)**, where I have the privilege of being advised by **[Prof. Eva Dyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sb_jcHcAAAAJ&hl)**. My research interests span **neuro foundation models**, **time series transformers**, **state space models**, and their applications, including **brain-computer interface** and **neural decoding**. Prior to this, I obtained a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at Université de Technologie de Compiègne. I also gained industry experience with large-scale datasets and applications as an intern at Deezer.
