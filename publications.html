              Understanding how the brain supports natural behavior is an increasingly central goal in human neuroscience.
              Recordings from human neurosurgical patients with intracranial EEG electrodes offer direct access to widespread
              brain electrical activity during a variety of behaviors over extended times. Despite the progress in the field,
              utilizing these recordings at scale to identify the neural underpinnings of natural human behavior remains difficult
              due to variability in electrode placement, channel geometry, and behavioral diversity across participants and sessions.
              To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised framework for multi-participant intracranial neural data.
              We use a Perceiver-based architecture to reconstruct masked channels of neural activity from unmasked channels using
              learnable embeddings of the channel identity and contextual information, capturing inter-channel dependencies without
              requiring labels. Finetuning of our self-supervised model has improved the decoding performance on a panel of downstream
              tasks, highlighting the potential of self-supervised learning to enable general-purpose neural decoding and support
              scalable integration of naturalistic human brain recordings.

              Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities.
              While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such
              as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during
              pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular
              pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of
              any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases
              across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a
              non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

              Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship
              between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural
              activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the
              bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model
              that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking
              strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the
              International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual
              decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for
              both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned
              embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each
              recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between
              neural activity and behavior.
